			This graph shows the percentage of substantiated complaints of excessive force used by NYPD officers over a period from September 1985 to January 2020. Substantiated in this case means the complaint was investigated by the CCRB who found that the misconduct occured and violated the rules.

				  Design Decisions and Rationale:

			  <ul>
				  <li>Used an intentionally vague title that did not clearly state what the percentage was being calculated out of. The percentage represents the number of substantiated complaints out of the total number of complaints made by people of each ethnicity. Rating: -2</li>
				  <li>Added an average line to visually imply that people of certain ethnicities tended to be below averagely affected by excessive force. Rating: -1</li>
				  <li>Extended the width of the graph to make values appear closer upon first glance. Rating: -0.5</li>
				  <li>Only graphed substantiated complaints and intentionally did not describe the other values in the data field to make it seem like all other claims were false. Rating: -1.5</li>

      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="FOR.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				These two graphs show the total number of complaints made against NYPD officers over a period from September 1985 to January 2020 and the total that were found substantiated separated by ethnicity. The total includes substantiated complaints along with complaints that were exonerated or found unsubstantiated. Exonerated in this case means that after an investigation by CCRB, it was found that the conduct had occured but did not violate NYPD's rules. Unsubstantiated meants that the CCRD investigation was not able to conclude that the conduct occured and broke the rules.

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Used the count of substantiated complaints instead of a percentage to accurately show how skewed the data is. Rating: 1</li>
				<li>Also visualized the total number of complaints, which includes complaints that were either exonerated or found unsubstantiated to ensure that the issues associated with these complaints are not overlooked. Rating: 1.5</li>
				<li>Used similar tick marks on both graphs to make them easier to read together. Rating: 1</li>
				<li>Included context about what exonerated and unsubstantiated refer to in this case to ensure that someone viewing can understand the implications of the visualization. Rating: 1.5</li>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
		During my initial exploratory data analysis, I was unsure how to procede on making a visualization that argues against my claim. Most of the ways I first visualized the data showed a jarringly disproportionate amount of misconduct towards people of black or hispanic ethnicities. When I visualized the board disposition field, I noticed that the distribution of investigation conclusions were similar even when filtered by ethnicity. This led me to create the visualization above, which has surprised everyone that I have showed it to. Most people responded by asking how this graph was even possible without using any incorrect data. After considerable explanation of what the percentage was actually refering to, the visualization began to make much more sense contextually. This is the piece of the visualization that I believe to be the most misleading. When taken out of context, it can be interpreted as showing that people of black and hispanic ethnicities are less likely to be affected by excessive force that actually breaks the NYPD's rules. However, what it actually implies is that the investigatory agency looking into these complaints are less likely to find complaints made by people of black and hispanic ethnicities substantiated. By using a misleading title, I not only visualized a false narrative, but also distracted from the real issue presented.
	  </p>

		Another design choice in my visualization that I found to be particularly deceptive was the use of only substantiated complaints without explaining the context of the other values in the data field. These values shed light on possible issues with the investigatory body that currently looks into the complaints. A large portion of the data were unsubstantiated complaints that could be a result of limited investigatory power of the CCRD. The number of exonerated complaints could also possibly be explained by NYPD rules that are either not strict enough or too vague to be accurately interpreted. Ignoring these values in my visualization may cause viewers to overlook these possible issues. By including them in the second visualization I created, more attention is drawn to what I believe to be important factors to consider when arguing my proposition. The other visual elements that I chose were intentional to try to force the viewer to draw the intended conclusion from the visualization. At first I was unsure whether these elements of the visualization were objectively deceptive. If used in a graph that was not intentionally misleading, these elements could genuinely add to the readability of the graph. However, because they were used in a way that was intending to mislead the audience, I had to consider them at least somewhat deceptive.

		What surprised me the most while doing this assignment was how relatively easy it was to create a deceptive visualization. While I cannot comment on the ability of the visualization to deceive a well-trained eye, it was enough to initially confuse the people around me. While some of these design choices were intentionally and clearly deceptive upon explanation, most could be made unintentionally. This led me to consider what can and cannot be considered deceptive. Would it be deceptive if someone unintentionally creates a vague title or description of a visualization? The answer to this question was not immediately obvious, but I believe one of the most important factors for ethical analysis and visualization is the intention of the creator. Any arguments made by a visualization should come organically from an analysis of every fact of the data, not any information that is intended to be misleading or could be misunderstood. To create an ethical visualization, the viewer should be given as much information and context as possible in order to draw education observations from it.
